# JSON, CSV, and XML Data Generation API

## Description

This project provides an API that allows users to generate JSON, CSV, and XML data based on a provided prompt. It uses OpenAI's GPT model to create data formats dynamically, responding with the appropriate format based on the user's request.

The app is built with Flask and includes endpoints to handle requests for each data type:

- **JSON Generation**: Returns structured JSON data based on a prompt.
- **CSV Generation**: Creates a CSV file based on a user's prompt, ensuring that data is returned in a comma-separated format.
- **XML Generation**: (Endpoint not fully implemented in this version, but designed to support future XML-based requests).

This app is ideal for users who need to generate structured data in various formats quickly for testing or other purposes.

## Features

- **Generate JSON Data**: Users can input prompts and receive a pre-defined or AI-generated JSON object.
- **Generate CSV Data**: Allows users to generate CSV data based on instructions provided in the prompt.
- **JSON and CSV Endpoints**: Two routes for generating data in JSON and CSV formats.
- **Flask Backend**: Lightweight backend using Flask to handle HTTP requests.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model (commented-out in the code) for dynamic data generation based on text input.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed.
- **OpenAI API Key** (for AI-based data generation).
- **Flask** installed.
- **dotenv** for loading environment variables.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd yourrepository
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the Flask app locally:

1. In the project directory, run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Available Endpoints

- **GET `/`**: Renders the index page with general information.
- **GET `/JSON`**: Renders the page for generating JSON data.
- **POST `/generate_json`**: Accepts a prompt and returns generated JSON data.
- **GET `/CSV`**: Renders the page for generating CSV data.
- **POST `/generate_csv`**: Accepts a prompt and returns generated CSV data.
- **GET `/XML`**: Renders the page for XML data generation (not fully implemented yet).

### Example Request

#### JSON Data

To request generated JSON data, use the following POST request:

**Endpoint**: `/generate_json`  
**Method**: POST  
**Body**:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Generate a list of products with their IDs, names, and prices."
}
